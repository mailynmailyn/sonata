/profile
/createaccount
/getmatched
/matches

**For the CSS pages**
The pages we created for the assignment 2 to be marked and viewed are the ***scss*** pages in the ***styles*** folder (sonata/src/styles/)

As discussed with the professor, scss pages were fine to be submitted for this assignment, however if there are any questions, please email either student about the code. 

**For the HTML pages**
The pages we created for the assignment 1 to be marked and viewed are: 

```
LoginPage.js 
CreateAccPage.js
AboutPage.js
EditProfile.js
GenreSelection.js
MatchesPost.js
MatchesPre.js
Profile.js 
```

These are javascript files that return HTML.
